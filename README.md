Facebook sharing
=============================
A facebook style status sharing based on JQuery and Ruby on Rails.

CSS
=============================
Now I'm using Twitter's BootStrap.

Usage
=============================
It's quite straight forward, but still need to be polished.

If you want to use the Amazon search feature, you have to put your Amazon Keys in 
home_page_controller.rb.

TODO List
=============================
1. Unit Test.
2. Apply different CSS framework.
